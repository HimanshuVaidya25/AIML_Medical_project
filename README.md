This project is developed as part of the AI/ML Internship Assessment by Solar Industries India Ltd.
It is created by Himanshu Vaidya, a student of Data Science at G. H. Raisoni College of Engineering and Management.

The AIML MedInstruct Assistant is an AI-based application designed to generate safe, educational, and informative responses to health-related queries.
It uses LoRA fine-tuning on the Falcon-RW-1B model to build a lightweight and efficient AI assistant capable of running even on Google Colab Free GPU.

**Project Architecture**
Base Model: tiiuae/falcon-rw-1b
Fine-Tuning Technique: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)
Frameworks Used: Hugging Face Transformers, PEFT, BitsAndBytes, Accelerate
Development Platform: Google Colab
Trainable Parameters: ~1.5 Million only

**Working Process**

1. Dataset Preparation:
Instruction–Response pairs related to basic health guidance.
Example:

Instruction: Explain how to treat a mild fever at home safely.

Response: Rest well, stay hydrated, and avoid self-medication. Consult a doctor if fever persists for more than two days.

2. Model Loading: Falcon-RW-1B loaded in 4-bit precision for memory efficiency.

3. LoRA Adapter Application: Added trainable adapters on attention layers for low-resource fine-tuning.

4. Training: One epoch of fine-tuning using AdamW optimizer.

5. Adapter Saving & Inference: LoRA adapter saved as lora_adapter.zip and tested on sample queries.

**Example Output**

User Input:
What should I do for a mild headache?

Model Output:

Stay in a quiet, dark place and drink enough water.

Avoid screen time and rest your eyes.

If the pain continues, consult a healthcare professional.
